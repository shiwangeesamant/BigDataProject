# BigDataProject

The purpose of this project is to obtain the top rated pages from the list of pages in the given set of Wikipedia Articles. Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) is used to implement the PAGERANK Algorithm on the provided Wikipedia Dataset.

PageRank is a significant part of search engine optimization and is a link analysis algorithm applied by GOOGLE. It assigns a rank to each accessed webpage. 
 Evaluating PageRank involves evaluating all the links to the specific page. If a page is called or accessed by a lot of links then it will be ranked high among all searched pages.
